# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## UNRELEASED


- Redesign namespace auto-switching

  Previously, when you activated a Clojure view, Tutkain switched to the namespace declared in that view (or `user`/`cljs.user` if none).

  Now, Tutkain switches to the namespace declared in the current view right before evaluation.

- Print input on the client rather than the server

  This way the user gets instant feedback on what they sent for evaluation and further improves Tutkain's compatibility with nested REPLs.

- Add gutter marks to output view

  - `>` indicates input (for example, forms you send for evaluation)
  - `<` indicates an evaluation result
  - `<<` indicates a `tap>` result (if you have `tap_panel` enabled)
  - red `<` indicates an error

- Add support for `${ns}` evaluation variable

  For example, here's a key binding that switches into the namespace in the current view:

  ```json
  {
      "keys": ["alt+a"],
      "command": "tutkain_evaluate",
      "args": {"code": "(in-ns '${ns})"},
      "context": [{
        "key": "selector",
        "operator": "equal",
        "operand": "source.clojure"
      }]
  },
  ```

- Avoid interleaving evaluation results with stderr/stdout (experimental) #86
- Fix source file name in Clojure stack traces
- Add green dot to status bar connection status indicator
- Trim extra whitespace from ClojureScript error strings
- Print test summary in status bar instead of output view
- Don't print view evaluation result in output view #85
- Disable indent guides in output view
- Add connection uptime into disconnect quick panel list
- Set output view `scroll_past_end` to 0.1

## 0.13.0 (alpha) - 2022-02-20

- Add **Tutkain: Show ClojureDocs Examples** and **Tutkain: Refresh ClojureDocs Example Cache** commands

  If your caret is on a symbol and you run **Tutkain: Show ClojureDocs Examples**, Tutkain opens a split view with ClojureDocs examples for that symbol.

  If your caret is not on a symbol, Tutkain prompts you for the name of a symbol instead.

  The first use of **Tutkain: Show ClojureDocs Examples** requires an internet connection for downloading the example data. Subsequent uses will use the data cached on your hard drive. To refresh the example data, run **Tutkain: Refresh ClojureDocs Example Cache**.

- Take `in-ns` into account when determining the current namespace

- Add `auto_show_output_panel` setting

- Fix slurping into multi-arity function body

## 0.12.0 (alpha) - 2022-01-30

- BREAKING CHANGE: Remove all default key bindings (indent on Enter, ParEdit
  key bindings for preventing unbalanced S-expression delimiters) #78

  See [this message](https://github.com/eerohele/Tutkain/blob/develop/messages/0.12.0.txt) for information on how to restore those key bindings so that
  Tutkain works the same way it did before.

- Add support for using a panel instead of a view for REPL output #79

  To use a panel instead of a view, modify the key binding for your `tutkain_connect` command to pass the `"output"` argument:

  ```json
  {
      "keys": ["ctrl+c", "ctrl+x"],
      "command": "tutkain_connect",
      "args": {"host": "localhost", "output": "panel"}
  },
  ```

  By default, Tutkain continues to use a regular view for REPL output. This is subject to change while Tutkain remains in alpha.

- Add support for copying evaluation result into your clipboard

  To use it, define a key binding like this (via **Tutkain: Edit Key Bindings**):

  ```json
  {
      "keys": ["ctrl+c", "ctrl+p"],
      "command": "tutkain_evaluate",
      "args": {"scope": "outermost", "output": "clipboard"},
      "context": [{
        "key": "selector",
        "operator": "equal",
        "operand": "source.clojure"
      }]
  },
  ```

- Add support for disabling the backchannel

  By default, when Tutkain connects to a Clojure runtime, it opens a second socket connection that it uses for tooling-related messages such as auto-completions etc.

  You can now ask Tutkain not to open that connection. To do that, define a key binding like this:

  ```json
  {
      "keys": ["ctrl+c", "ctrl+m"],
      "command": "tutkain_connect",
      "args": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "backchannel": false,
        "output": "panel"
      }
  },
  ```

- Show connection status indicator in status bar

- Fix symbol information lookup and auto-completion support when connecting to a shadow-cljs socket server without first connecting to a Clojure server

- Add **Tutkain: Choose Active Runtime** command.

  You can use it to choose which runtime to evaluate against when you use a panel for REPL output and you're connected to multiple runtimes that use the same Clojure dialect.

- Fix inline evaluation result placement
- Don't hide evaluation results when modifying the current selection #80
- Prevent errant `nil` prints when using inline evaluation results with ClojureScript
- Add `extend_comment` (default `true`) argument to the `tutkain_insert_newline`
  command

  If you set `extend_comment` to `false`, pressing Enter will no longer
  automatically insert a double semicolon at the beginning of the new line.

- Set horizontal window layout to half-and-half for code view and REPL view
- Fix `(read-line)` support
- Fix forward/backward delete for illegal `\characters`

## 0.11.0 (alpha) - 2021-11-23

- Improved support for nested clojure.main REPLs

  Evaluation results are no longer wrapped in prepl-like message frames (`{:tag ret :val ,,,}` etc.). Evaluations now send character streams and receive character streams. Standard output (`println`), exception messages, and tapped values are now sent over the same backchannel Tutkain uses for other IDE-like features (auto-completion etc.)

- Add **Tutkain: Explore Stack Trace** command

  See [Exploring exception stack traces](https://tutkain.flowthing.me/#exploring-exception-stack-traces) for more information.

- Add **Tutkain: Dir** command

  See [Listing all public vars in a namespace](https://tutkain.flowthing.me/#listing-all-public-vars-in-a-namespace).

- Add locals highlighting support for ClojureScript

- If you evaluate a view with a syntax error, show an error in the REPL view
- Tutkain now switches to the namespace in the current view after evaluating a view (via **Tutkain: Evaluate** Â» **View**)
- Show progress indicator when evaluating view #59
- Fix evaluation prompt

  Previously, pressing Enter would insert a line break instead of submitting the evaluation.

- Allow evaluating input when a non-Clojure view is active
- Improve auto-completion support for Java methods, fields, and classes
- Improve auto-completion UI
- Improve syntax definition for Java interop special forms
- Fix test detection error #74
- Fix lookup support for symbols that start with <
- Add `views` argument to **Tutkain: Clear Output View** (thx @perdorgirardi)

  Pass `["repl"]` to clear only the REPL view, `["tap"]` to clear only the tap panel, or `["repl", "tap"]` to clear both.

- Highlight current line when navigating unsuccessful tests via **Tutkain: Show Unsuccessful Tests** (thx @pedrorgirardi)

- Add **Tutkain: Toggle Auto Switch Namespace** command

  Namespace auto switching can interfere with nested clojure.main REPLs. You can assign a key binding to this command to temporarily disable namespace auto switching when working with nested REPLs.

  This is not a perfect solution. Suggestions welcome.

- Add **Tutkain: Prompt** command

  See [Prompting the user for evaluations](https://tutkain.flowthing.me/#prompting-the-user-for-evaluations).

- Improve shadow-cljs support backwards compatibility

  Tutkain no longer relies on the internal `shadow.cljs.devtools.server.repl-impl/do-repl` function.

- Fix prints from (`print`, `spec/explain`, `criterium/bench`, etc.) not
  showing up

- Fix **Tutkain: Apropos** result sorting
- Add **Tutkain: Loaded Libs** command
- Prevent disconnect on evaluating empty input

## 0.10.0 (alpha) - 2021-09-15

- Improve the UI of the **Tutkain: Show Unsuccessful Tests** command #65 (thx @pedrorgirardi)
- Add **Tutkain: Apropos** command
- Improve UX of **Tutkain: Show Information**

  Tutkain now no longer opens the target file in a split view.

- Fix auto-completion for top-level classes (e.g. `clojure.lang.*`)
- Fix goto definition on Windows
- Improve locals highlighting when destructuring a namespaced keyword #55
- Fix support for `tutkain_connect` `host` argument

  For example, say you specify a key binding like this:

  ```json
  {
      "keys": ["ctrl+c", "ctrl+x"],
      "command": "tutkain_connect",
      "args": {"host": "localhost"}
  },
  ```

  Then Tutkain no longer prompts you for the hostname when connecting.

- Fix doc popup arglists font
- Assign correct syntax when going to definition inside JAR (thx @pedrorgirardi!)
- A number of minor bug fixes and improvements

## 0.9.0 (alpha) - 2021-08-21

- Fix auto-completion and doc popups when connected to both Clojure and ClojureScript socket REPLs
- Add backchannel `bind_address` setting #57 (thx @dmitrydprog!)
- Use first instead of last ns form for ns auto-switch
- Avoid dangling paren after forward barf
- Optimize finding the outermost S-expression under the cursor
- Add support for highlighting/selecting locals (via the `tutkain_select_locals` command).

  Clojure only; requires [clojure.tools.analyzer.jvm](https://github.com/clojure/tools.analyzer.jvm) to be in the classpath.

- Fix errors when setting thread-bound dynamic variables in clojure.test tests #53
- Fix `:tutkain/disconnect` when printing from Clojure test
- Prevent auto-completion popup from disappearing when manually typing the entire prefix #60 (thx @dmitrydprog!)
- Add `dialect` arg to `tutkain_evaluate` command

  Instead of picking up the evaluation dialect from the currently active view, you can set it explicitly. For example:

  ```json
  {
      "keys": ["f19"],
      "command": "tutkain_evaluate",
      "args": {"ns": "user", "code": "(reset)", "dialect": "clj"},
  },
  ```

- Add experimental shadow-cljs socket REPL support

    shadow-cljs only for now, until I can figure out the intricacies of getting
    a hold of the compiler environment with different ClojureScript tools.

- Add experimental Babashka socket REPL support

- Add `extend` arg to ParEdit Forward/Backward commands

    If `extend` is `true`, extend the current selection in addition to moving the caret.

- Add support for evaluating snippets (see documentation).
- Add :require/:import indentation compatibility mode

    If there's no newline between `:require` and the thing that immediately follows it, Tutkain will now format subsequent `:require` lines the same way. If there's a newline after `:require/:import`, Tutkain will indent the same as before. **Experimental, may be removed in the future**.
